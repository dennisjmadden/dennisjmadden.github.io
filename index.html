I'm      a registered dietitian with a PhD in evidence-based medicine. Check out my      <a href="Madden%20CV.pdf">CV</a> and list of <a href="file:///Users/dennismadden/Documents/dennisjmadden.com/Scientific%20Publications.pdf">academic        publications</a>.</p>    <p>At various points in my life I've called myself a runner, triathlete,      climber, cyclist, diver (SCUBA and springboard), skier and snowboarder. I      like to exercise and get outside, I am always chasing some random fitness      goal. I think running in the woods is my favorite.</p>    <p>I created anotherdamnfitnessblog.com to practice writing. The site is no      longer up, but you can find the articles <a href="articles.html">here</a>.</p>    <p>Perhaps to balance out my physical identity, I secretly wish I was some      sort of artist. </p>    <p>I consider myself a stoic and I believe in integrity, humility, and the      beginner mindset.</p>    <p>What I'm up to right now</p>    <h2>Articles</h2>    <p>Coming soon. </p>    <p><br>    </p>    <p><br>    </p>    <p><br>    </p>  </body></html>
