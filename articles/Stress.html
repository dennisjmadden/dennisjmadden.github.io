Or why 3 runs a week is working for me right now</h2>    <p>By <a href="/">Dennis Madden</a></p>    <p>As an introduction consider these major events in my life over the past      year&nbsp;(not all bad!)</p>    <ul>      <li>Furiously writing my PhD thesis.</li>      <li>Defending that thesis</li>      <li>Planning a wedding</li>      <li>Moving halfway around the world</li>      <li>Wedding!</li>      <li>Moving across the country</li>      <li>Furious job search (FJS) begins</li>      <li>Passed up on for a few (dozen) jobs</li>      <li>FJS continues</li>      <li>Inherit a 45 yr old motorcycle.

In that case I've just aged at a      rate of about&nbsp;500% this year. As you can guess, now is not the time      to push for that marathon record, or get on that lifting program to hit a      2x bodyweight deadlift. So what am I doing?</p>    <p>As someone who always has some sort of goal or program in mind and works      out 6 to 7 days a week, you can see where I'd get into trouble. As I've      written before, at some level, stress is stress, whether it comes from an      18 mile run or the baseline fear that you're pissing your career away.</p>    <p>I have found a few things that are working for me&nbsp;though, and anyone      who finds themselves in this kind of situation could probably follow a      similar template. Keep in mind that my norm is some sort or run training      (5 to 7 days a week) along with some sort of lifting program (likely      something from Dan John).</p>    <p><strong>Running:</strong> I made it a goal to run three times a week, <em>all
        at <a href="http://www.anotherdamnfitnessblog.com/2014/03/10/why-easy-running-is-awesome/">easy
          pace</a></em>. The result? I am getting close to my performance marks      from last year when I was running double that I am now! Keep in mind I was      piling higher millage during a stressful time so I was probably failing to      adapt optimally, in other words, if I was doing that volume during stress      free days I would have probably been even better. I do throw in one long      run when things feel good, more on that below.</p>    <p><strong>Lifting:</strong> This is the biggest change for me, switching to      less formal training. One of the key moves was joining a climbing gym with      my wife. A day of climbing "counts" as a workout in my head (as opposed to      something like 5 x 5 of heavy squats etc). These days are fun; I get to      spend quality time with the Mrs, move my body in challenging ways (rock      climbing is like yoga except&nbsp;you go up) and the recovery demand is      quite small. This allows more recovery in general with the mental ease of      getting my workout in for the day.&nbsp;This is huge and I think one of      the key reasons I am doing so well right now! I do lift 1 to 3 times a      week, usually superseding classic opposing exercise like dips and      pull-ups, for high volume. I do lower volume on legs and keep them to 1      time a week because I am running long.</p>    <p><strong>Goals:</strong> One goal. I am planning on doing the <a href="https://www.thenorthface.com/get-outdoors/endurance-challenge/california.html">North
        Face 50k</a> in Marin in December. I'm not trying to place or anything,      I just want to be prepared enough so I can finish with a smile feeling      strong. There really is only one workout that matters. The long run. I've      been building up and I can currently tick off 18 miles with a payday bar      and a few bottles of water. I get these in whenever I can, usually spaced      out every 7 to 10 days. I will keep building as I feel comfortable until      race time. All the rest is details, lifting and climbing to keep me      balanced, and a few runs during the week to keep things in the groove.</p>    <p>So far it's been working fantastically. This is not a post about      minimalist running schedules, this is what works for me during this time      of my life. If things were different you can bet my workout routine would      look different too, but there are some common themes here that can be used      by anyone during stressful times. Beware of the major pitfall that is all      too common in the media right now, that a "time-crunched" athlete needs to      maximize their minimal time with max effort. Not true for all but maybe a      handful of genetically gifted individuals out there!</p>    <p>This life/exercise balance is one of the things I've really come to      appreciate as I hit my 30's. The younger me <del>probably</del> wouldn't      have been this conservative, and would have chalked up the resulting      injuries to something beyond my control. Lame. Instead acknowledge that      life is a constant ebb and flow, and sometimes you have bide your time and      choose your battles. In the end, I try to <a href="http://www.anotherdamnfitnessblog.com/2015/03/16/why-walking-is-freakin-awesome/">do
        something every day</a> and not worry too much when I go a day without a      formal workout, and it's made a huge difference.</p>  </body></html>
