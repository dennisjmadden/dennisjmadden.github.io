        Michael Joyner's blog</a>. I think everyone can pull a few nuggets of      wisdom out of this, but for anyone who works in healthcare, this is a      goldmine! It reads more like a slide presentation rather than a book so      it's easy to get through&nbsp;and will provide plenty of material and      references for presentations etc.&nbsp;Here are just a few interesting      bits (in no particular order) I pulled from this after my initial glance.</p>    <ul>      <li>Life expectancy in the US is lower than most developed nations, and in        some regions in the US it's equal to some&nbsp;developing nations.</li>      <li>30% of a populations&nbsp;health is determined by genetics...but 40%        is determined by lifestyle choices. Sure, individual values may vary,        but the message is clear; lifestyle is the biggest piece of the pie.</li>      <li>Diet type didn't really matter&nbsp;(of these three: low carb, low        fat, Mediterranean). More important was adhering to it!!!        <ul>          <li>Notice these three types come up often... (HINT!)</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Smoking is really really bad. If you do it figure out a way to quit        yesterday. Yes, this is not news, but this report really puts how        damaging it is into perspective. We all know it's bad yet &gt; 40        million Americans still do it.        <ul>          <li>"Sin tax" seems to work, we should probably consider this for junk            food too.            <ul>              <li>On the flip side of sin tax, increasing coupons for fruit and                vegetables in WIC programs correlates with a decrease in obese                and overweight children.</li>            </ul>          </li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>There is good discussion of altering&nbsp;the environment to encourage        more movement...<a href="http://www.anotherdamnfitnessblog.com/2015/05/08/design-some-movement-back-into-your-life/">sound
          familiar</a>?</li>      <li>Our portion sizes are huge. We know this, but there are some good        visuals here. Our child size drink from McDonalds is the same size as a        Japanese medium. Oh, and Japan has some of the lowest rates of obesity        in the world.</li>      <li>Inactivity is a huge problem.</li>      <li>Inactivity is really a huge problem.</li>      <li>Inactivity is seriously a really huge problem.</li>    </ul>    <p>These are just a few of the takeaways. It was interesting to see another      source reinforce the idea that there is no one ideal diet type. Rather      than debate over the details let's again look at the real culprits. Too      much food, way too much fake food, and too little activity. Get those      squared away in your own life before you get all hot-and-bothered whether      or not dairy is paleo.</p>  </body></html>
