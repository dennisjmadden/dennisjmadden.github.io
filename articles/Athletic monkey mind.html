        I did but don't realistically do today. (As in multiple times per month,        or high priority during weekends). See the relationship between this        line and the one above here?</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span          style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Things
          I actually do.</span></span></p>    <p>There are many things I identity with and have invested time and money      in, but upon reflection, I haven't done these in quite some time.</p>    <p>Now I see why I'm not as good as I fantasize I can be at any one thing.      This also puts into perspective what I&nbsp;actually do vs. what      I&nbsp;think I do. I've been having this conversation with my brother      about several different topics lately (not just sports or hobbies). If I <em>really&nbsp;</em>want
      to be fencing right now, I'd be out there doing it. But I'm not.</p>    <p>Sometime&nbsp;l whine to myself&nbsp;that I "deserve" to be a better      runner, but look at all the other stuff I've clogged my head with over the      past 12 years. I am a gear hoarder. Maybe keeping all this equipment on      hand keeps a little fuel on the delusion wild fire in my head. Many of      this stuff I could probably rent. Take diving for example. I bought all      this stuff but I will likely only dive on vacations, a situation where I      will rent anyway! Same goes for a lot of the other stuff on this list. A      friend of mine rented a road bike for an Ironman we did...and he kicked      ass. Granted he has bikes at home to train on, but the point is he did      fine without the fanciest of gear.</p>    <p>Monkey mind is a Buddhist term describing an unsettled state. Does this      describe you? Want to be good (and probably save yourself some $$)? Audit      your monkey mind, find out what you actually do vs. what you think you'd      like to do. Maybe clarity will help you up your game. Of course this has      to be balanced with exploring new activities.</p>    <p>When you open the door be mindful not to let all the monkeys in.</p>  </body></html>
