Thinking off the top of my head, there are two options.      You could paint the whole rainbow and represent the different bands of      color with various shades of red. Or you might sketch out the rainbow, but      only paint the red stripe. Both are incomplete. Now, your red stripe may      be the best damn red stripe I've ever seen, but it's not a complete      rainbow. Agreed?<br>      <br>      Now imagine you want to change your health or body composition, but all I      tell you is what I think people should eat. See where I'm going with this?      It's not really a complete answer. This is one downside to the endless      amount of resources online. Now nutrition blogs are more popular than      ever. Unfortunately, most of them fall into the category of 'eat like me'      blogs. ELM blogs usually feature pretty pictures, both of food and the      writers, and are quick to point out all the benefits of their way and the      pitfalls and poisons of conventional wisdom. To further complicate things,      not all the information on these blogs is good information. Some may mean      well but give false information, or worse, some may give false information      on purpose because it sells. But I digress.<br>      <br>      The problem with only being told what to eat is that it's usually not      enough to truly make a lifelong change. That's even if the advice is 100%      legit! But this type of information is really easy to put out passively on      a blog. Since the other colors of the rainbow can be so illusive, it's      easy to get caught fruitlessly seeking endless shades of red thinking      you'll one day find the right one that suddenly (and with minimal effort)      solves all your problems.<br>      <br>      You need more than red. Maybe you have a history with body image or      disordered eating that needs resolving. Get some help and add some orange      to your pallet. Then you realize it's important to understand your      cravings and triggers. Hey look, green! Next you learn about setting      yourself up for success by the way you shop, or that health isn't      reflected in&nbsp; a mirror or comparisons to pictures that are      photoshopped out of reality. Enter blue and purple. Now you're getting      close to a rainbow.<br>      <br>      Red is actually an easy color to get. We pretty much know what good      nutritious food is, and that we should avoid sugary and processed foods.      Red is so easy in fact, that Michael Pollan's now famous quote "Eat food.      Not too much. Mostly plants." tells you at least 80% of what you need to      know in just seven words! If you spend all your time looking for the      perfect shade of red, you'll miss out on the other colors. Even if you      find the perfect shade of red you still don't have the whole rainbow.</p>  </body></html>
