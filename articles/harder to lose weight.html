        have it harder than the 'boomers when it comes to weight loss?!</a>      Unfortunately I don't have $35.95 sitting around to purchase a single      article, but based on media statements from one of the authors and the      abstract, I still think we can get some useful insight and use this to put      things into perspective.<br>      <br>      Basically it comes down to this: given that a Boomer and a Millennial      consume the same amount of calories and get the same amount of activity,      the Millennial will have a BMI ~ 2.3 kg/m2 higher than the Boomer. Not      Fair! The author speculates a variety of reasons for this (chemicals, lack      of sleep, stress, gut bacteria etc).<br>      <br>      So how does this work? Eat less, lose weight, eat more and gain right? The      classic argument is often called calories in vs. calories out (let's call      is CIO for now): you know this as energy balance. Consume more than you      burn, you gain, and so on. Lately people seem to be pretty polarized      feeling that the only thing that matters for weight loss is CIO or on the      other hand, saying CIO doesn't matter as long as you eat the right stuff.      As with most things the truth lies somewhere in the middle.<br>      <br>      There are many factors that influence whether or not you lose weight like      those listed above, including CIO. It seems that CIO, overall, plays a      smaller role in weight management than it did in the past. The idea of CIO      "mattering" more or less is not too foreign, we all know someone who seems      to eat whatever they want and not gain a pound&nbsp; compared to people      that have to weigh out every gram and be "perfect" just to drop a few      pounds.<br>      <br>      Now lets talk about relativity. Is it that the importance of CIO got      smaller or if the importance of everything else ballooned around it? In      other words, is CIO the same as it's always been (it is thermodynamics      after all...) but it's relatively smaller compared to all the other      factors, many of them associated with our modern lifestyle? If CIO is of      lesser relative importance, that means you'd have to have a much more      drastic change to impact the whole system. Bingo.<br>      <br>      The problem with CIO is not so much the concept (again...physics...) but      that it's one of the factors that gets the most attention because 1) it's      kinda obvious right? and 2) these days it's relatively easy to measure and      track. So it's really more evidence that we have to consider some of the      stuff that a lot of people ignore because we, at home, can't easily      measure it. This "other" stuff is also often ignored for being      touchy-feely, hippy, or holistic.<br>      <br>      We need to think "wholistic" as in considering everything: sleep, stress,      chemical exposure etc, which is different than holistic, which conjures up      images of magical thinking (to be fair there is some common ground between      the two). In other words, if you feel like you've cut calories to the bone      and still can't lose weight, it's time to look in areas other than CIO.      Although it doesn't give us any hard evidence on other causes, at least it      demonstrates that CIO is not the end-all be-all of weight management.<br>      <br>      Where do we start? Sleep is a good place. IMO it's not given a high enough      priority. Reduce processed foods, manage stress as best as you can      (meditation? therapy? we all have issues). Cultivate a healthy gut      microbiome, get outside and get dirty, don't sanitize your world and eat      fermented foods. Speaking of priority, how high is health actually on your      list? How many things do you "not have time for" vs how much time do you      waste on tv/internet/or just sitting around?<br>      <br>      The take-home is this. CIO, while important, is not everything. If you are      having trouble with weight management even though you eat pretty well,      maybe it's time to consider other areas, even those you might have      dismissed in the past.<br>      <br>      &nbsp;</p>  </body></html>
