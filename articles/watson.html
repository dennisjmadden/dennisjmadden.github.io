        and Under Armour are teaming up to "revolutionize" the fitness industry.</a>      The idea is that if they&nbsp;combine tracking devices/data, a      supercomputer, and data science, it would be possible to get revolutionary      insights&nbsp;in fitness and nutrition for the user. As a physiologist and      dietitian, I am always interested in news like this as technology,      wearables, and hyper-connectedness becomes a reality of the health/fitness      industry. This type of data can be useful, but "revolutionize" is a bold      claim. What follows are my thoughts, and keep in mind I really don't know      how the app works, or how they intend to use it - this is just      speculation. I hope I'm proven wrong in the most delightful of ways,      because science is cool!</p>    <p>One&nbsp;hurtle I see is the individual response to exercise (you could      include the response to food and dietary intake&nbsp;here as well). If it      was&nbsp;as universal as&nbsp;'X'&nbsp;workout at 'Y' volume gives you 'Z'      results then things would be pretty simple. It's not. There are many      different permutations of the same variables that can take you to the same      endpoint . . . or to a completely different one. Back to      individuality.&nbsp;We've all noticed this, maybe without recognizing it      as the 'individual response to exercise', yet&nbsp;hating it's realities      nonetheless. It's your friend that "eats like crap" yet still has the same      body they did in high school, the guy who runs a marathon 30 minutes      faster than you despite half the weekly training milage, lifting partners      that keep getting stronger while you plateau, and the odd way fat seems to      be stored on your body compared to Brad Pitt. Insight based only on      training parameters&nbsp;is going to be missing this important      individuality component.&nbsp;Even within yourself things like health      status (sleep, adequate nutrition, stress, absence of disease and injury)      alter the effectiveness of your exercise.</p>    <p>The same goes for nutrition. People live well on all&nbsp;sorts of diets      depending on many individual factors including genetics (which is      rightfully receiving increased attention in the research world). Some may      thrive on a hi carb/low fat diet while the exact opposite might be true      for others. That's why universal recommendations beyond the obvious (eat      less sugar and processed foods + more vegetables) are difficult to apply      to large populations. We can really apply that to any area of health. Are      you going to start smoking because of the persistent&nbsp;rumor about      the&nbsp;90 year old woman who smoked 2 packs a day all her life without a      trace of lung cancer?</p>    <p>Despite these limitations there are still some uses for big data in      fitness, like&nbsp;as a reality check of what it <em>really</em> takes to      meet your goals. For example, I could look up&nbsp;the      average&nbsp;training volume of Ironman Kona qualifiers in&nbsp;my age      group and compare it to my own. If it's 16 hours a week and I'm only      training 10, should I be surprised when I don't get an invitation to the      race?&nbsp;Maybe&nbsp;you think you deserve to be faster, stronger, or      leaner for your efforts and you think you've been given a raw deal in the      genetics department. It might be helpful to see that other people in your      category are doing (maybe working twice as hard as you). It would&nbsp;be      a good bullshit detector too.&nbsp;Maybe you'll see&nbsp;that weight loss      takes persistence and habits far different than your own,&nbsp;or you need      to double down on your efforts rather than skip around from snake oil to      magic tonics.</p>    <p>So where does technology, including the insights of supercomputers and      wearables fit in?One of the complaints I hear about fitness trackers is      that the answer is rarely a surprise. Given the choice I think we'd all      rather take more steps and sleep more every day. So if I only run 30 miles      a week do I need a supercomputer to tell me I'd be faster if I run 50      miles a week? Or that my weight loss has stalled because I actually eat      3000 calories a day and average 3000 steps? Maybe some people would rather      hear it from Watson than that little voice of reason in the back of their      own head.</p>    <p>This individual component will need to be solved for technology to really      shine. A better question might be "Why am I so slow compared to people      doing the exact same thing as me? This is where having a coach or      dietitian comes in handy, but not every one has, wants, can afford, or      even knows what to look for in one. Will tech be able to become better      than the experience and gut intuition of a good coach? Maybe someday, but      that day is not today.</p>    <p>While&nbsp;I think there's some interesting stuff that could be done, I      don't think it will revolutionize the fitness industry. Not yet anyway.      The reality is that given an unrealistically average human, especially on      paper, the process of making them&nbsp;stronger, faster, leaner, bulkier,      or whatever isn't that difficult. The hard part for the individual is      having the discipline to get it done, and for the coach to navigate      reality of individuality and the influence of the environment      on&nbsp;exercise and training. Who knows, once wearables can track things      like infections, blood glucose, heart rate variability and general health      status, combined&nbsp;with some genetic testing, maybe&nbsp;the diagnostic      and prescriptive power will improve.</p>    <p>Even when the above comes to be I assume most of us who are limited by      things like time, motivation, obligations, and distractions (rather than a      lack of knowledge about what to do next) will still face the same      barriers. In that case you need to re-examine your priorities, not have a      supercomputer tell you to walk more.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>  </body></html>
