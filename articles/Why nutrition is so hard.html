It      really made me think about the state of things because of how stranded I      felt without service. In other news I will soon be opening a remote      nutrition private practice for those who are interested in working with me      as an RD. Right now the target start date is mid September, I'll be      posting more on this in the future.</p>    <p>In light of the above announcement, I've been doing a lot of deep      thinking about being a good dietitian, effective counseling, and the state      of nutrition information in general. I've also been doing a lot of reading      and listening to super smart people when they share their research and      techniques.</p>    <p>Part of my initial thoughts are really taking the time&nbsp;to get to      know what we're up against when we're trying to reshape nutrition habits.      Sure, you could say the problem is basically a combination of over eating      processed foods and poor sources of information, but that's like      describing a Ferrari as "a car, usually red, with four wheels. Fast" So in      the interest of going a little deeper, here is what I came up with.      Ultimately we have to know what we're up against to develop effective tool      chest of countermeasures. Here we go!</p>    <p><strong>Chemical Addiction</strong></p>    <p>Sugar, carbs, salt, and alcohol are all things that can elicit cravings      at a deep subconscious level. Everyone has probably seen the headlines in      mass media&nbsp;about the study where rats <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/10/18/rats-find-oreos-as-addictive-as-cocaine-an-unusual-college-research-project/">chose
        Oreos over cocaine</a>. Therefore, in some cases we might need to look      at sugar/processed carbs (or any other addictive food) as an addiction      that needs to be addressed&nbsp;with techniques more advanced than "don't      eat them" (these will likely be borrowed from other areas of addiction      counseling). It's not that simple, just like you wouldn't expect to be      able to treat&nbsp;a drug addict by telling them to&nbsp;"Stop doing      heroin...okay? Good".</p>    <p><strong>What we though we knew...</strong></p>    <p>Not only did we used to&nbsp;think that smoking wasn't bad for us, but      that it would actually open up your lungs to prepare you for vigorous      physical activity! Unfortunately I don't know the source of this next      tidbit&nbsp;but to paraphrase it, some well known health expert basically      said that all the medical advances and techniques we have up to      date&nbsp;have just about evened the balance of the damage to life and      health that&nbsp;smoking has caused. Trans fats were developed to be      healthier than animal fats, now they are banned. It's funny how it's often      man-made products that don't stand the test of time...</p>    <p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>    <p>I'd hate to say it, but anything that involves food and retail&nbsp;has a      priority that isn't your&nbsp;health; I'll give you one guess what it is      (yes, it's money).&nbsp;While commercials featuring&nbsp;uber fit families      may convince you otherwise, rest assured it's&nbsp;all part of the plan.      Gatorade doesn't care about your sports performance (their lab is really      hard to take seriously) they care about convincing you that you need      sugary salty nuclear horse piss&nbsp;to run around the block. Obviously      food isn't evil just because you bought it from Kraft, you just need to      check where your information is coming&nbsp;from and remember the first      sentence of this paragraph.</p>    <p>In this category you might as well toss in&nbsp;a lot of new fitness      technology like that bottle that connects to your phone and tells you how      much water to drink. You know, because people drop dead of dehydration      because they didn't know they were supposed to drink. You know what people      do drop dead from? Drinking too much water (the kickstater youths would do      well to read up on Tim Noakes) because marketing tells them to drink on a      schedule in order to sell&nbsp;products.</p>    <p><strong>Willful misinformation</strong></p>    <p>This is a level of crap lower than marketing. Look, food companies      promoting vegetables as cancer-fighting superfoods isn't evil, it's just      marketing. There are some companies, often pushing supplements, that are      just flat-out lying to you about their products. Again, mostly      supplements.&nbsp;Be weary of any claims that just sound too good to be      true. "Superfoods" is kind of a bullshit word too. If all we had to do to      live to 100 was take resveratrol then we'd all live to 100. We'd also all      be as ripped as Spartan warriors because we drink pomegranate juice, and      be skinny and free of toxins&nbsp;because we drink some tea made from bark      of the swindleberry tree. But if these companies lie why don't they get in      trouble? They do, but the FDA &nbsp;and bureaucracy in general is slow,      and entrepreneurs are sharp-witted, nimble and wealthy from profiting on      lies and human misery like that pink slime in Ghostbusters 2 . Again, if      it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</p>    <p><strong>Lobbyists</strong></p>    <p>Digging down another layer into the hive of scum and villainy (thank you      Obi-Wan, you have some great one-liners) you have lobbyists, or people who      try to change laws and government policies in the interest of big      companies (see point #3 above). You have these guys to thank for the      original&nbsp;food pyramid, you know the one that promoted 8 to 12      servings of carbs a day and made us all obese. Why? To find a use for all      that extra corn and grain that the government was subsidizing, that's why!      Things are getting better in this internet age of free information      exchange. As we can now more easily share knowledge, we don't need to      swallow information like that bullshit commercial a few years ago where      those two moms are making juice-pop and one leaps to the defense of high      fructose corn syrup. Do yourself a favor and read Death by Food      Pyramid...now.</p>    <p>So that's actually a lot to deal with, and you can see it's not as simple      as choosing a calorie count or finding cutesy little ways to sneak      vegetables into your lasagna without your family noticing. Does it feel a      little overwhelming? Being up against organizations with literally      billions of dollars at their disposal with the single goal to take your      money? Products that are apparently more addicting than cocaine?! It      almost seems like there should be professionals who spend their time      learning how to get you through this mess. Enter the&nbsp;RDs (the      non-corrupted ones) of the world!</p>    <p>I will probably add to this list in the future. Leave a comment if you      have something else that fits up here, it will help make me a better      dietitian.</p>  </body></html>
