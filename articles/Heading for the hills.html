This is probably a sign that I should expand      beyond&nbsp;my MS Office circle; pdf slide shows? Why not!</p>    <p>I don't write much about my personal life, I'd rather try and put out      some useful info, but <a href="http://www.anotherdamnfitnessblog.com/2015/09/22/stress-or-why-3-runs-a-week-is-working-for-me-right-now/">my
        last post</a> was a combination of the two (I hope), so I'll roll with      that for today and hope that someone somewhere can take something away      from this.</p>    <p><strong>Life/athletic balance</strong></p>    <p>Anyone who's competed knows how much life stress in general can impact      training schedules and game day. That's one main advantage of being a      professional; many sources of stress that the working-athlete has to deal      with are potentially eliminated. To be fair, I think the stresses of going      pro would be much worse. Doping scandals, winning, keeping sponsors, even      making sure you are making enough to pay the bills. No thanks!</p>    <p>The point is, there is something to be said for aligning your bucket list      athletic events with times in your life when everything is running      smoothly. <a href="https://coachgordo.wordpress.com">Coach Gordo</a>&nbsp;writes
      about this,&nbsp;that the most crucial element to your training and thus      racing success (in this case Ironman triathlon) is setting your life up to      be able to train consistently for 1000 days. This is more than long enough      to see if certain habits are not sustainable in the long term for you,      your spouse, or your family. Sure, you might borrow some family time on      weekends a few months before a marathon for some long runs, but the point      is to develop a schedule that is repeatable and fits into your existing      non-negotiable obligations. I have known people to choose sport over      family and it&nbsp;makes me feel sad. Adding pressure and ruining      relationships...for what? A sub XX:XX:XX (insert event here) that probably      100,000 people around the world could do?</p>    <p>The younger me never understood this and many people still don't; the      training itself, picking up weights, running etc, is just details (you      still have to be smart about those details!). Far more important is      getting&nbsp;your life together and creating a platform of health,      balance, and contentment in which to build on.</p>    <p>People make long term plans for their careers, finances, and retirement,      etc. It might not be a bad idea to have a rough plan beyond "someday I      want to do a marathon". Put it to paper and see where it fits in with all      the other stuff going on.</p>    <p><strong>My example...</strong></p>    <p>This weekend we're heading for the hills. It will be a good time for some      self examination Zoolander style (minus the gasoline fights). My excuse is      the word "when". I always say when.&nbsp;<em>When&nbsp;</em>I have a job      then I'll do _______.&nbsp;<em>When&nbsp;</em>I get a certain number of      readers per month I'll consider starting a private nutrition practice. <em>When
        </em>I feel confident enough I'll try to establish myself as a thought      leader<em>.&nbsp;</em>I've been sitting on a bunch of&nbsp;<em>whens</em>      lately and it's hard to move on because understanding&nbsp;the      cause&nbsp;of my hesitation&nbsp;requires a little brutal honesty. I'm      glad I caught myself doing this now; no one wants to look back and realize      they were waiting for conditions that never came to be.</p>    <p>Have a great weekend!</p>  </body></html>
