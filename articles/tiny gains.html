Lately the topic of stress and lack of time has come      up again and again in my social circles. This is really no surprise since      my social circle consists of what I'd guess to be one of the busiest      groups - the "have it all" group. In my social circles people&nbsp;start      family planning in their early 30's rather than 20's. The 20's in turn      were spent&nbsp;exploring the world and multiple careers changes, it's      likely that things career-wise really start to come together&nbsp;at this      age too.</p>    <p>Considering the above, it's no surprise that things in the fitness and      training category could slip do to a lack of time. During my college years      it was a lot easier work enough training to complete an Ironman that it is      today. What I've found is my strategy for fitness is evolving, getting      more holistic, and much more intelligent as I make better use of my time.      So far this hasn't been a sacrifice and I still think my best      athletic&nbsp;performances are yet to come.</p>    <p>What's changed?</p>    <ul>      <li>An appreciation for recovery. In exchange I can really let it rip when        the time is right.</li>      <li>Reeling in the ego and becoming more humble: someone out there will        always be faster, stronger, and more skilled. While I used to see this        as a challenge to my pride, I now get excited to hang out with these        folks in hopes that they can help me up to their level.        <ul>          <li>In fact, I used to wish I was the best in the club, now, if that            were the case I'd seek out a new club!</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Doing&nbsp;<em>anything</em>&nbsp;is better than nothing. If you can        find 10 minutes you can do something. If you can't find 10 minutes        something needs to change.        <ul>          <li>Once you get a few little "doing anything" workouts, try to make            them better over time. For example...            <ul>              <li>I use a "death by pushup" workout as one of my busy day                workouts. I set a timer for 10 minutes and I start by doing 2                pushups on the first minute, 4 on the next , then 6 etc until I                get to 10 minutes. That's a decent workout for 10 minutes. I                usually can't complete the workout (110 pushups)! Imagine how                badass I'd be If I could use 5 as my multiplayer instead of 2                (275 total, possibly impossible, but fun to dream about...)!                Cramming lots of pushups into a short amount of time can give                you that "whole body tired" feeling, provided you are doing them                properly.</li>            </ul>          </li>          <li>Of course, the same workout format works with any other movement.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>If you are training for something you need to recognize what the best        use of your time is. Marathon? Long run. Rock climbing? Rock climbing.        Power lifting? Yep, you guessed it, power lifting. While it looks like        I'm being a smart-ass, if you are into a sport the best way to get        better is to practice that sport. In the age of internet expert strength        and conditioning gurus,&nbsp;people would like you to believe that you        can pick up some kettlebells then run a marathon or level-up your        climbing.        <ul>          <li>Not to say that you shouldn't do supplemental training, but take            the time to learn what is truly holding you back in your            development.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>I try to work movement and activity in anyway I can, and I see it all        as supplemental training. Walking &gt; biking &gt; public transit &gt;        driving. Take the stairs, carry the boxes yourself, do everything by        hand that you can. It's all training! Sit on the floor. Mobilize while        you watch TV.</li>      <li>Try something new or find a class. Dabble and explore.</li>    </ul>    <p>This gentler attitude is a far cry from a 12 hour-a-week Ironman specific      training program, like those I did in my 20s when I chastised myself for      missing a workout from a plan that was't crafted for me or my life.      However, I think this attitude can be worked into a decent training      schedule if you want to compete in Crossfit, weightlifting, or some epic      endurance challenge. What I see as&nbsp;the main difference between myself      now and then is my&nbsp;ability to alter or even miss workouts in order to      maintain&nbsp;health, movement quality, and save&nbsp;your efforts for      when they really count.</p>    <p>The idea of using daily "anything" and small gains can certainly be      applied to specific goals as well as general fitness. By the way, this      whole post could be applied to nutrition too. I'm going to have fun      exploring this concept, nutritionally and for training, as it relates to      specific sports.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>  </body></html>
