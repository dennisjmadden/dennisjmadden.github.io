What were they      doing?</h2>    <p>By <a href="/">Dennis Madden</a></p>    <p>Last week, ABC News did a segment detailing a sneak-peak into Apple's      multi-million dollar exercise physiology lab:</p>    <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQgCib21XRk</p>    <p>When you watch that video, you see all sorts of space-age looking      equipment strapped to peoples' faces while they're exercising. But what is      it stuff? What are they measuring,&nbsp;and what does the data they're      collecting have anything to do with the products      Apple&nbsp;sells?&nbsp;That's what I'll look at in this post.</p>    <p>It's no secret that Apple is entering the wearable fitness market with      the Apple&nbsp;Watch. But as you can image, a wrist-worn device is not      exactly the best&nbsp;way to measure every&nbsp;fitness parameter (which      is why you see all these crazy contraptions in the video).</p>    <p>Of course the machinery more suited to the task is&nbsp;found in an      exercise physiology lab, is much larger than a wristwatch, and is much      more expensive. (Yes, even compared to the much talked-about $17,000 Apple      Watch Edition.) So while a watch is not strictly the best way to measure      fitness and activity, it's obviously more convenient than a lab full of      equipment.</p>    <p>Ok, so let's get into the details. For reasons which aren't worth going      into here, the calorie is the unit of measure most casual people care      about, and it's the main "intelligence" they want out of a fitness tracker      (such as the Apple&nbsp;Watch) in addition to the basics&nbsp;like steps      taken and distance covered. "Siri: How many calories did I burn walking to      get this latte?"</p>    <p>One of the most accurate ways to estimate the calories someone&nbsp;burns      is to measure the air they&nbsp;breathe out. Since the Apple      Watch&nbsp;can't do this, engineers need to look at the data their device      can collect and then match it with the more accurate laboratory data the      exercise scientists collect. In the&nbsp;video from Apple's fitness lab,      it appears the team is collecting laboratory data on the calorie cost of a      variety of exercises like running, cycling, rowing, and yoga (which they      focus on <em>a lot</em>. Apparently yoga is trendy&nbsp;among Apple      customers. Not so much ring fighting.)</p>    <p>Anyway, so how do the lab scientists collect calorie data with all those      expensive-looking machine? The main things you see in the video are gas      analyzers, and the ones I've worked with in the past&nbsp;cost about as      much as an entry-level BMW 3 series. (So they <em>look</em> expensive      because they <em>are</em> expensive. Seriously. Just looking at how many      they have in the video shows where the multi-million dollar price tag      comes from.)</p>    <p>These devices measure the composition (oxygen and carbon dioxide) and      volume of the gas someone&nbsp;breathes out. Since we know&nbsp;the      characteristics of atmospheric air (~21% oxygen, 0.05% carbon dioxide),      measuring the composition and volume of exhaled air can determine how much      oxygen was utilized by that person's&nbsp;body (they measure a lot more      than "how hard you breathe"). Once that&nbsp;is paired with how much      carbon dioxide a person&nbsp;produces, it's possible to get a pretty good      idea of&nbsp;how much energy they're&nbsp;using&nbsp;at the moment      (calories) and what the source of the energy is (fat or carbohydrate).</p>    <p>If you managed to make it through that paragraph, what you might have      noticed is that these expensive machines <em>don't actually directly        measure calories burned</em>. (Calories are a unit of heat and these      things measure gas.) But we can assume (based on previous research) that      every liter of oxygen a person&nbsp;consumes equates to&nbsp;about 5      calories burned. As a rough example, a 75kg person (yeah we scientists use      metric) consumes about 3.5 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of      bodyweight every minute just sitting there doing nothing, which equates to      about 1872 calories in 24 hours.&nbsp;When a person&nbsp;increases      their&nbsp;workload and starts breathing harder, they're increasing      their&nbsp;oxygen consumption and therefore their&nbsp;rate of burning      calories to supply their&nbsp;now harder-working muscles. So a machine      that measures how much oxygen was consumed each breath can provide&nbsp;a      decent estimate of calorie burn. (How you <em>actually</em> measure      calorie burn is an interesting story too, but we'll talk about that in a      future post.)</p>    <p>The Apple video also shows off a few neat-looking climate chambers where      they're able to simulate hot or cold&nbsp;weather&nbsp;conditions. Since      the environment (temperature, humidity, altitude, and weather) definitely      affects your performance, oxygen consumption, and (therefore) the calories      you burn, a device that can measure environmental parameters like      temperature or pressure (altitude) can potentially provide a more accurate      estimation of calories burned compared to&nbsp;one that doesn't.</p>    <p>Each stage of the testing lets the scientists add extra variables into      the equation. Things get even more interesting when you get down to the      individual level. Body types (think relatively longer arms or shorter      legs) modify how each person burns calories in different activities, along      with muscle fiber composition, lifestyle, previous athletic history, and      genetics are all individual variables. (So bad news to everyone who wants      to track every calorie burned. Two 1.80m tall 30yo men weighing 75kg each      running side-by-side down the road at the same speed will each burn a      different amount of calories during&nbsp;that run.) On top of that, the      environmental factors listed above&nbsp;that can drastically impact      exercise performance on a day-to-day basis (and also at different amounts      to different people). Even running on a treadmill vs running outside at      the same speed can have different results. That's one of the advantages of      the portable equipment they use (although they are always on treadmills in      the video, who knows if they took any of these devices outside or not?).</p>    <p>The bottom line is that no matter how much laboratory testing and      calibration goes into a device, individual results will&nbsp;vary!</p>    <p>Of course the final question is what to do with the data? Sure, knowing      how much activity you get every day can help with targets and goals, and      the gamification potential could certainly help with motivation and habit      building. But what do you get from knowing 30 minutes of yoga burns 125      calories or that&nbsp;getting more sleep will improve your energy levels?      If I had an answer right now I'd share it. As someone who has studied      nutrition and exercise physiology for 11 years I think healthy living      boils down to consistency. Whatever a device does it needs to guide you      from a life of inactivity to one of movement and joyful exercise. Good      things happen when you keep healthy habits for&nbsp;life, not just for a      few weeks until you get bored or finish that 5k. I'm all for improving      sensor technology and increasing measurable parameters, but there is still      a lot to be done to figure out how to best utilize this capable      technology.</p>  </body></html>
