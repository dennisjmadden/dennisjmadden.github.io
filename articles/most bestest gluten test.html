Although in this case the "secret" was already published.</p>    <p>He wrote of this test&nbsp;in his book <em>Serve to Win</em>&nbsp;in      2010, but no one cared until he won. Good for him! The story is      that&nbsp;a fellow countrymen and&nbsp;MD approached Novak&nbsp;offering      an explanation for why he couldn't break through to the top level of      tennis. The reason: gluten!</p>    <p>But the doctor couldn't tarnish the reputation of good-natured gluten      without mean ol' Mr Evidence, so he had to test his theory first to—you      know—make sure it's not some crazy theory he made&nbsp;up based      on&nbsp;bandwagon armchair pseudoscience. The test? Since you'll      absolutely&nbsp;think I'm joking if I tell you, I'll grab a quote from the      <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/health/wimbledon-winner-novak-djokovics-diet-secret-for-123916056833.html?soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma">article</a>:</p>    <p><em>He had me place my left hand on my belly, and put my right arm        straight out to the side.&nbsp;</em></p>    <p data-reactid=".0.$cover-mosaic-transition-group.$=1$cover-mosaic-0:0.$article-123916056833.0:$Pos-r.$article-inner-container.$inset-container.$grid-template.0.$col-left.$content.$grid-content.0.1.1.$text-body.0.2.$p-1"><em>“I
        want you to resist the pressure,” he said as he pushed down on my right        arm.

        he said, and laughed. “Hold it against your stomach, and put your right        arm out again.” Once more, he pushed down on my arm, explaining to me        that this crude test would tell me whether or not I was sensitive to        gluten, the protein in wheat, barley, rye, and other common bread        grains.</em></p>    <p data-reactid=".0.$cover-mosaic-transition-group.$=1$cover-mosaic-0:0.$article-123916056833.0:$Pos-r.$article-inner-container.$inset-container.$grid-template.0.$col-left.$content.$grid-content.0.1.1.$text-body.0.2.$p-7"><em>This

        yet, there was a noticeable difference. With the bread against my        stomach, my arm struggled to resist Dr. Cetojevic’s downward pressure.

      would've known that the very same test used to "prove" the efficacy of <a        href="http://www.insideedition.com/investigative/2024-inside-edition-investigates-power-bracelets">magnetic
        bracelets</a> could also demonstrate a gluten intolerance?</p>    <p data-reactid=".0.$cover-mosaic-transition-group.$=1$cover-mosaic-0:0.$article-123916056833.0:$Pos-r.$article-inner-container.$inset-container.$grid-template.0.$col-left.$content.$grid-content.0.1.1.$text-body.0.2.$p-9">So
      . . . the gluten radiates out from the bread? Does it have to be pressed      to your stomach? If it's pressed to your head, will you forget your home      address? Does&nbsp;a whole loaf do it&nbsp;from a foot away? Would you      crumple to your knees if you walked past a bakery?</p>    <p data-reactid=".0.$cover-mosaic-transition-group.$=1$cover-mosaic-0:0.$article-123916056833.0:$Pos-r.$article-inner-container.$inset-container.$grid-template.0.$col-left.$content.$grid-content.0.1.1.$text-body.0.2.$p-9">Look,
      I get it. Some people have celiac disease and true gluten intolerances.      But in general, this whole "sensitivity" thing is way overblown. Many      blogs and websites with young beautiful authors (so, not this one) will      shout the glory of gluten-free from the mountain tops.</p>    <p data-reactid=".0.$cover-mosaic-transition-group.$=1$cover-mosaic-0:0.$article-123916056833.0:$Pos-r.$article-inner-container.$inset-container.$grid-template.0.$col-left.$content.$grid-content.0.1.1.$text-body.0.2.$p-9">Try
      it yourself. If you feel better, great! But if you're going to do      non-validated tests on yourself, or recommend them to others, you have to      be okay with the idea that the improvement you feel is all in your head;      the placebo effect. Of course if you know that, and you don't care and      wish to stay the course, then rock on! (Seriously! That's great!)</p>    <p data-reactid=".0.$cover-mosaic-transition-group.$=1$cover-mosaic-0:0.$article-123916056833.0:$Pos-r.$article-inner-container.$inset-container.$grid-template.0.$col-left.$content.$grid-content.0.1.1.$text-body.0.2.$p-9">The
      problem is&nbsp;telling people&nbsp;to cut out gluten carries little risk.      People don't need gluten&nbsp;to survive, and when they cut it out they'll      probably stop eating a bunch of processed crap which will inevitably lead      to them feeling better, losing a few pounds, and converting to the faith.      Gluten-free is all good until you finally get sick of making stale bread      with 24 ingredients, most of which have to be purchased from specialty      stores.</p>    <p data-reactid=".0.$cover-mosaic-transition-group.$=1$cover-mosaic-0:0.$article-123916056833.0:$Pos-r.$article-inner-container.$inset-container.$grid-template.0.$col-left.$content.$grid-content.0.1.1.$text-body.0.2.$p-9">As
