        the Calorie is Broken</a> yesterday fully expecting to grumble, roll my      eyes, and explain to my cat that physics is still a thing. A&nbsp;title      like that is surely there to grab your&nbsp;attention. My internal      monologue was immediately yelling 'the calorie is a unit of measure, how      can it be broken?'. Anyway, fast forward to me me finishing the article      with a fist pump thinking 'right on man!' - there's still lots to be done      in the world of nutrition science!</p>    <p>First off, the article is&nbsp;a nice little primer on where the calorie      came from, and how crazy it is to actually figure this stuff out. I've      debated the "<a href="http://www.anotherdamnfitnessblog.com/2014/02/06/is-a-calorie-just-a-calorie/">is
        a calorie just a calorie</a>" <a href="http://www.anotherdamnfitnessblog.com/2014/02/16/is-a-calorie-just-a-calorie-part-2/">argument</a>      <a href="http://www.anotherdamnfitnessblog.com/2015/01/02/calorie-restriction-is-not-a-myth/">before</a>      on this blog always with the same conclusion: <a href="http://www.anotherdamnfitnessblog.com/2015/01/07/264/">it's
        not that simple.</a> You don't eat calories, you eat food. That's what      makes it so difficult to use formulas, fitness trackers, labels, and      scales to predict weight loss. We're not a closed system of test tubes and      burners consuming purified caloric solutions in triple-walled crucibles.      The article highlights how many different ways the calorie content of food      varies depending on preparation, as well as how accurate the measurement      actually is so I won't repeat it here. I've written in the past how, even      with the latest tech and an army of exercise physiologists, <a href="http://www.anotherdamnfitnessblog.com/2015/03/26/a-breakdown-of-apples-exercise-physiology-lab/">the
        fanciest fitness trackers are just making guesses on your calorie        expenditure</a>.</p>    <p>Next we have individual variation, and on top of that, variation within      the individual. Your metabolism is a constantly moving target. I mean      constantly, hour-by-hour. Go find another person your same height and      weight and compare notes. Do you think you two always eat&nbsp;the same      amount of calories? Taking these variations into account, it's no surprise      then that calculators and formulas that try to predict caloric needs,      while a good rough start, may stray considerably from reality.</p>    <p>So let's step back for a second. The point of the above was to highlight      how much estimation, guesswork, assumption, yet-to-be discovered      science,&nbsp;and individuality is involved in the whole calories in vs.      calories out puzzle and it's easy to see why the numbers with your food      diary&nbsp;app and Fitbit don't match up with reality.</p>    <p>The article offers a few ideas&nbsp;and even indirectly supports the      simplest of nutrition advice, which is to <a href="http://www.anotherdamnfitnessblog.com/2014/04/14/fruit-juice-and-chicken-breasts/">avoid
        processed foods</a>. Additionally, the idea of eating only to satiety      (rather than to clean your plate) has merit, and if you can master that,      you&nbsp;can probably skip all the diet plans out there (as long as your      satiety is calibrated properly...hey look, another&nbsp;issue!).</p>    <p>Other simple advice? Cook your own food. I'm not saying to never eat out,      but it's easy to see how those that do so several times a week are faced      with an yet another&nbsp;set of challenges. In addition to the highly      variable calorie content of food items, you have to contend with crazy      large portion sizes and (depending where you choose to eat) the addition      of things like salt, msg, and sugar strategically placed to increase      consumption and mess with your sense of satiety.</p>    <p>In defense of the calorie it's not exactly something that people conjured      out of thin air or made up. As it's been said, you make the best decisions      with the information you have at the time. I don't think      researchers&nbsp;set out with the idea to screw you over with the concept      of calorie counting. The problem is that we humans are darn complicated,      so having one piece of scientifically sound information is not enough to      complete the puzzle. While calorie counting is far from perfect, you can      at least use it to get a general idea of things which in turn can be      useful on your way to becoming a more informed eater.</p>    <p>I like some of the ideas on other systems to use for consumption other      than the calorie and I will certainly be learning more about them in the      near future.&nbsp;Mindful eating and re-calibrating your satiety and      hunger cues is always a good place to start. I also agree that      you&nbsp;shouldn't hold your breath for food labels to change any time      soon. The gut bacteria is really intriguing too and is quite hot right now      in many areas of research (even in SCUBA diving: We've discussed early      research that certain types of bacteria could be protective of      decompression sickness, aka - the bends.) which is awesome. There is a      reason why there is no one "perfect" diet, once we figure that out we can      finally move on to some more interesting stuff.</p>  </body></html>
